# Credit Approval System

## Overview

This project implements a Credit Approval System, which is a backend application built using Node.js and Express. The system is responsible for assessing credit eligibility based on past data and handling future transactions. It includes APIs for registering customers, checking loan eligibility, creating loans, making payments, and viewing loan statements.

## Features

- Register new customers with approved credit limit based on salary
- Check loan eligibility based on credit score and loan amount
- Create new loans for eligible customers
- Make payments towards loan EMIs
- View statements for specific loans

## Setup and Initialization

2. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. **Database Setup**: Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system. Update the database connection settings in `config/db.config.js` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. **Data Ingestion**: Run the data ingestion script to populate the initial system with customer and loan data from Excel files. Execute `node scripts/dataIngestion.js`.

5. **Start Server**: Start the server by running `npm start`. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
